This repository contain the differents files requested in th final project of the course: **Getting and Cleaning Data** from **JHU**.

## Goal of the Project:
Demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be required to submit: 
1) A tidy data: This dataset is ready for any later analysis.
3) CodeBook.md: It describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
4) Analysis.R script: Contains the code R realized (step by step).

## Contributions:
Feel free to provide any suggestions for improving the code after I confirm that this work has already been reviewed and graded.
