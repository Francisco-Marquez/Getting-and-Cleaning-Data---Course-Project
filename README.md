## Goal of the Project
1) A tidy data set as described below
2) A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3) A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4) An analysis_R script.

## Review criteria
1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
